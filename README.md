# GTA classification
ROB 535 Final Project (Perception)

In this project, we need to classify which category the car in the image belongs to.

We built our own Convolution Neural Network, which you can check in `train.py`, to solve this classification problem.

# Install
```
pip install numpy scipy tensorflow pandas
```

# Train
```
python train.py
```
The weight of the trained model will be stored in the `weight_path`.

# Test
```
python test.py
```
The weight of the pretrained model can be obatained from `weight_path`.
